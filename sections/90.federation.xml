		<p>The Buddycloud service is designed to work with interchangeable components
			that offer discrete services and together form a complete communication
			service.
		</p>
		<p>While the Buddycloud Server is designed to work independently of other
			services but can be enhanced with helper services. Each helper communicates
			with the Buddycloud server and other components using XEP-0114 connections.
			Examples of helper services include: push notifications, media hosting,
			contact matching, content search and channel recommendations.
		</p>
		<p>Helper services' specifications are covered in separate XEPs.
