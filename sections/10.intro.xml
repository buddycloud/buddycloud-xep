		<p>The Buddycloud project attempts to define a common set of non-silo'd
			communication tools, services and libraries that help developers build
			federated communication applications and services.
		</p>
		<p>The buddycloud stack is a collection of services, running as XMPP
			components that enable rich, federated communications between individuals and
			groups. Buddycloud builds on XMPP's native federation and pub-sub principles
			to connect to and synchronise content with followers on local and remote
			domains.

	<section2 topic='Buddycloud Channels' anchor='Buddycloud Channels'>
		<p>
			Buddycloud channels are a bundle of pub-sub nodes presented as a JID-like
			name (example:
			<link url='buddycloud:juliet@capulit.lit'>juliet@capulet.lit</link>
			. Content posted into channels is automatically synchronised to the correct
			followers on other Buddycloud domains.
