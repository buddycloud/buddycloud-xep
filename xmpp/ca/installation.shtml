<title>XMPP ICA: Certificate Installation HOWTO</title>
<!--#include virtual="/includes/head.txt" -->
<h2>XMPP ICA: Certificate Installation HOWTO</h2>
<p>Once you have obtained a domain certificate from the <a href='/ca/'>XMPP ICA</a> as explained in the <a href='issuance.shtml'>Certificate Issuance HOWTO</a>, proceed as follows to install your certificate. If you have any questions throughout this process, feel free to contact <a href='https://stpeter.im/index.php/contact/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a> via email or (for faster service) IM.</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>Back up your "domain.csr", "domain.crt", and "domain.key" files and save them to a secure location. It's also a good idea to copy the .crt and .key files ('cp domain.crt domain.crt.in' and 'cp domain.key domain.key.in') so that they are not accidentally overwritten in the steps we describe below.</p></li>
  <li><p>Download the <a href='https://cert.startcom.org/sub.class1.xmpp.ca.crt'>ICA certificate</a> ("sub.class1.xmpp.ca.crt").</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>Decrypt your "domain.key.in" file using the password you provided during certificate creation. You can do this using OpenSSL with the following command:</p>
    <pre>openssl rsa -in domain.key.in -out domain.key.out</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Concatenate your "domain.crt.in" file, the ICA certificate, and your decrypted "domain.key.out" file so that your server can present the entire certificate chain:</p>
    <pre>cat domain.crt.in sub.class1.xmpp.ca.crt domain.key.out &gt; domain.crt.out</pre>
    <p>Your "domain.crt.out" file should look something like this:</p>
    <pre>
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
beginsomelongstringoflettersandnumbershere
...
endsomelongstringoflettersandnumbershere
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
beginsomelongstringoflettersandnumbershere
...
endsomelongstringoflettersandnumbershere
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
beginsomelongstringoflettersandnumbershere
...
endsomelongstringoflettersandnumbershere
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li><p>If your XMPP server software is written in Java (e.g., <a href='http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/index.jsp'>Openfire</a>, <a href='http://www.openim.techlab.smk.fr/en/'>OpenIM</a>, <a href='http://www.sun.com/software/products/instant_messaging/'>Sun Java System IM</a>, or <a href='http://www.tigase.org/'>Tigase</a>), you will need to enable large key sizes by installing the "Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files" available at &lt;<a href='http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp'>http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp</a>&gt;.</p></li>
  <li><p>Copy the "domain.crt.out" file to the machine where you run your XMPP server. Depending on your XMPP software, you may need to rename the file to "domain.pem" (e.g., this is true for the jabberd 1.x codebase).</p></li>
  <li><p>Check the file permissions to make sure that the "domain.crt.out" file is readable by your server software.</p></li>
  <li><p>Configure your server software for SSL/TLS communication in accordance with its documentation.</p></li>
  <li><p>Restart your server software.</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>Test the results by logging in using a recent release of any standard XMPP client. If you are running the legacy SSL-only port 5223, you also test by downloading the <a href="https://cert.startcom.org/ca.crt">StartCom root certificate</a> to your local machine and running the following OpenSSL command in the directory where you downloaded the root certificate:</p>
    <pre>openssl s_client -connect your.server.tld:5223 -CAfile ca.crt -showcerts</pre>
    <p>Note: If the s_client command shows only one certificate ("Cert 0" = your domain certificate) instead of two certificates ("Cert 0" = your domain certificate and "Cert 1" = the XMPP ICA intermediate certificate) then your server software is not presenting the entire certificate chain. You may need to upgrade to a more recent version of your server software!</p>
  </li>
