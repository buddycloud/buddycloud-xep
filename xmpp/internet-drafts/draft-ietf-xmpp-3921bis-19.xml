  <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
    <section title="Overview" anchor="intro-overview">
      <t>The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is an application profile of the Extensible Markup Language <xref target="XML"/> that enables the near-real-time exchange of structured yet extensible data between any two or more network entities.  The core features of XMPP defined in <xref target="XMPP-CORE"/> provide the building blocks for many types of near-real-time applications, which can be layered on top of the core by sending application-specific data qualified by particular XML namespaces (refer to <xref target="XML-NAMES"/>).  This document defines XMPP extensions that provide the basic functionality expected of an instant messaging (IM) and presence application as described in <xref target="IMP-REQS"/>.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="History" anchor="intro-history">
      <t>The basic syntax and semantics of XMPP were developed originally within the Jabber open-source community, mainly in 1999.  In late 2002, the XMPP Working Group was chartered with developing an adaptation of the core Jabber protocol that would be suitable as an IETF IM and presence technology in accordance with <xref target='IMP-REQS'/>.  In October 2004, <xref target='RFC3920'/> and <xref target='RFC3921'/> were published, representing the most complete definition of XMPP at that time.</t>
      <t>Since 2004 the Internet community has gained extensive implementation and deployment experience with XMPP, including formal interoperability testing carried out under the auspices of the XMPP Standards Foundation (XSF).  This document incorporates comprehensive feedback from software developers and service providers, including a number of backward-compatible modifications summarized under <xref target='diffs'/>.  As a result, this document reflects the rough consensus of the Internet community regarding the IM and presence features of XMPP 1.0, thus obsoleting RFC 3921.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Requirements" anchor="intro-requirements">
      <t>Traditionally, IM applications have combined the following factors:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>The central point of focus is a list of one's contacts or "buddies" (in XMPP this list is called a "roster").<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          <t>The purpose of using such an application is to exchange relatively brief text messages with particular contacts in close to real time -- often relatively large numbers of such messages in rapid succession, in the form of a one-to-one "chat session" as described under <xref target='message-chat'/>.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          <t>The catalyst for exchanging messages is "presence" -- i.e., information about the network availability of particular contacts (thus knowing who is online and available for a one-to-one chat session).<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          <t>Presence information is provided only to contacts that one has authorized by means of an explicit agreement called a "presence subscription".</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>Thus at a high level this document assumes that a user needs to be able to complete the following use cases:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>Manage items in one's contact list</t>
          <t>Exchange messages with one's contacts</t>
          <t>Exchange presence information with one's contacts</t>
          <t>Manage presence subscriptions to and from one's contacts</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>Detailed definitions of these functionality areas are contained in RFC 2779 <xref target="IMP-REQS"/>, and the interested reader is referred to that document regarding in-depth requirements.  Although the XMPP IM and presence extensions specified herein meet the requirements of RFC 2779, they were not designed explicitly with that specification in mind, since the base protocol evolved through an open development process within the Jabber open-source community before RFC 2779 was written.  Although XMPP protocol extensions addressing many other functionality areas have been defined in the XMPP Standards Foundation's XEP series (e.g., multi-user text chat as specified in <xref target='XEP-0045'/>), such extensions are not specified in this document because they are not mandated by RFC 2779.</t>
      <t><list style='empty'><t>Implementation Note: RFC 2779 stipulates that presence services must be separable from IM services and vice-versa; i.e., it must be possible to use the protocol to provide a presence service, a messaging service, or both.  Although the text of this document assumes that implementations and deployments will want to offer a unified IM and presence service, it is not mandatory for an XMPP service to offer both a presence service and a messaging service, and the protocol makes it possible to offer separate and distinct services for presence and for messaging.  (For example, a presence-only service could return a &lt;service-unavailable/&gt; stanza error if a client attempts to send a &lt;message/&gt; stanza.)</t></list></t>
    </section>
    <section title="Functional Summary" anchor="intro-summary">
      <t>This non-normative section provides a developer-friendly, functional summary of XMPP-based IM and presence features; consult the sections that follow for a normative definition of these features.</t>
      <t><xref target="XMPP-CORE"/> specifies how an XMPP client connects to an XMPP server.  In particular, it specifies the preconditions that need to be fulfilled before a client is allowed to send XML stanzas (the basic unit of meaning in XMPP) to other entities on an XMPP network.  These preconditions comprise negotiation of the XML stream and include exchange of XML stream headers, optional channel encryption via Transport Layer Security <xref target='TLS'/>, mandatory authentication via Simple Authentication and Security Layer <xref target='SASL'/>, and binding of a resource to the stream for client addressing.  The reader is referred to <xref target="XMPP-CORE"/> for details regarding these preconditions, and knowledge of <xref target="XMPP-CORE"/> is assumed herein.</t>
      <t><list style='empty'><t>Interoperability Note: <xref target='RFC3921'/> specified one additional precondition: formal establishment of an instant messaging and presence session.  Implementation and deployment experience has shown that this additional step is unnecessary.  However, for backward compatibility an implementation MAY still offer that feature.  This enables older software to connect while letting newer software save a round trip.</t></list></t>
      <t>Upon fulfillment of the preconditions specified in <xref target="XMPP-CORE"/>, an XMPP client has a long-lived XML stream with an XMPP server, which enables the user controlling that client to send and receive a potentially unlimited number of XML stanzas over the stream.  Such a stream can be used to exchange messages, share presence information, and engage in structured request-response interactions in close to real time.  After negotiation of the XML stream, the typical flow for an instant messaging and presence session is as follows:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>Retrieve one's roster.  (See <xref target='roster-login'/>.)<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          <t>Send initial presence to the server for broadcast to all subscribed contacts, thus "going online" from the perspective of XMPP communication.  (See <xref target='presence-initial'/>.)<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          <t>Exchange messages, manage presence subscriptions, perform roster updates, and in general process and generate other XML stanzas with particular semantics throughout the life of the session.  (See <xref target='message'/>, <xref target='sub'/>, <xref target='roster'/>, and <xref target='iq'/>.)<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          <t>Terminate the session when desired by sending unavailable presence and closing the underlying XML stream. (See <xref target='presence-unavailable'/>.)<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
        </list>
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Terminology" anchor="intro-terms">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <xref target='KEYWORDS'/>.</t>
      <t>This document inherits the terminology defined in <xref target="XMPP-CORE"/>.</t>
      <t>The terms "automated client" and "interactive client" are to be understood in the sense defined in <xref target="TLS-CERTS"/>.</t>
      <t>For convenience, this document employs the term "user" to refer to the owner of an XMPP account; however, account owners need not be humans and can be bots, devices, or other automated applications.</t>
      <t>Several other terms, such as "interested resource", are defined within the body of this document.</t>
      <t>Following the "XML Notation" used in <xref target="IRI"/> to represent characters that cannot be rendered in ASCII-only documents, some examples in this document use the form "&amp;#x...." as a notational device to represent <xref target='UNICODE'/> characters (e.g., the string "&amp;#x0159;" stands for the Unicode character LATIN SMALL LETTER R WITH CARON); this form is definitely not to be sent over the wire in XMPP systems.</t>
      <t>In examples, lines have been wrapped for improved readability, "[...]" means elision, and the following prepended strings are used (these prepended strings are not to be sent over the wire):</t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>C: = client</t>
          <t>CC: = contact's client</t>
          <t>CS: = contact's server</t>
          <t>S: = server</t>
          <t>UC: = user's client</t>
          <t>US: = user's server</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>Readers need to be aware that the examples are not exhaustive and that, in examples for some protocol flows, the alternate steps shown would not necessarily be triggered by the exact data sent in the previous step; in all cases the protocol definitions specified in this document or in normatively referenced documents rule over any examples provided here.  All examples are fictional and the information exchanged (e.g., usernames and passwords) does not represent any existing users or servers.</t>

  <section title="Managing the Roster" anchor="roster">
    <t>In XMPP, a user's roster contains any number of specific contacts.  A user's roster is stored by the user's server on the user's behalf so that the user can access roster information from any device.  When the user adds items to the roster or modifies existing items, if an error does not occur then the server SHOULD store that data unmodified if at all possible and MUST return the data it has stored when an authorized client requests the roster.</t>
    <t><list style='empty'><t>Security Warning: Because the user's roster can contain confidential data, the server MUST restrict access to this data so that only authorized entities (typically limited to the account owner) are able to retrieve, modify, or delete it.</t></list></t>
    <t>RFC 3921 assumed that the only place where a user stores their roster is the server where the user's account is registered and at which the user authenticates for access to the XMPP network.  This specification removes that strict coupling of roster storage to account registration and network authentication, with the result that a user could store their roster at another location, or could have multiple rosters that are stored in multiple locations.  However, in the absence of implementation and deployment experience with a more flexible roster storage model, this specification retains the terminology of RFC 3921 by using the terms "client" and server" (and "the roster" instead of "a roster"), rather than coining a new term for "a place where a user stores a roster".  Future documents might provide normative rules for non-server roster storage or for the management of multiple rosters, but such rules are out of scope for this document.</t>
    <section title="Syntax and Semantics" anchor="roster-syntax">
      <t>Rosters are managed using IQ stanzas, specifically by means of a &lt;query/&gt; child element qualified by the 'jabber:iq:roster' namespace.  The detailed syntax and semantics are defined in the following sections.</t>
      <section title="Ver Attribute" anchor="roster-syntax-ver">
        <t>The 'ver' attribute is a string that identifies a particular version of the roster information.  The value MUST be generated only by the server and MUST be treated by the client as opaque.  The server can use any appropriate method for generating the version ID, such as a hash of the roster data or a strictly-increasing sequence number.</t>
        <t>Inclusion of the 'ver' attribute is RECOMMENDED.</t>
        <t>Use of the 'ver' attribute is described more fully under <xref target='roster-versioning'/>.</t>
        <t><list style='empty'><t>Interoperability Note: The 'ver' attribute of the &lt;query/&gt; element was not defined in RFC 3921 and is newly defined in this specification.</t></list></t>
      </section>
      <section title="Roster Items" anchor="roster-syntax-items">
        <t>The &lt;query/&gt; element inside a <xref target='roster-syntax-actions-set'>roster set</xref> contains one &lt;item/&gt; child, and a <xref target='roster-syntax-actions-result'>roster result</xref> typically contains multiple &lt;item/&gt; children.  Each &lt;item/&gt; element describes a unique "roster item" (sometimes also called a "contact").</t>
        <t>The syntax of the &lt;item/&gt; element is described in the following sections.</t>
        <section title="Approved Attribute" anchor="roster-syntax-items-approved">
          <t>The boolean 'approved' attribute with a value of "true" is used to signal subscription pre-approval as described under <xref target='sub-preapproval'/> (the default is "false", in accordance with <xref target='XML-DATATYPES'/>).</t>
          <t>A server SHOULD include the 'approved' attribute to inform the client of subscription pre-approvals.  A client MUST NOT include the 'approved' attribute in the roster sets it sends to the server, but instead MUST use presence stanzas of type "subscribed" and "unsubscribed" to manage pre-approvals as described under <xref target='sub-preapproval'/>.</t>
          <t><list style='empty'><t>Interoperability Note: The 'approved' attribute of the &lt;item/&gt; element was not defined in RFC 3921 and is newly defined in this specification.</t></list></t>

        <section title="Ask Attribute" anchor="roster-syntax-items-ask">
          <t>The 'ask' attribute of the &lt;item/&gt; element with a value of "subscribe" is used to signal various subscription sub-states that include a "Pending Out" aspect as described under <xref target='sub-request-outbound'/>.</t>
          <t>A server SHOULD include the 'ask' attribute to inform the client of "Pending Out" sub-states.  A client MUST NOT include the 'ask' attribute in the roster sets it sends to the server, but instead MUST use presence stanzas of type "subscribe" and "unsubscribe" to manage such sub-states as described under <xref target='sub-request-outbound'/>.</t>

        <section title="JID Attribute" anchor="roster-syntax-items-jid">
          <t>The 'jid' attribute of the &lt;item/&gt; element specifies the Jabber Identifier (JID) that uniquely identifies the roster item.</t>
          <t>The 'jid' attribute is REQUIRED whenever a client or server adds, updates, deletes, or returns a roster item.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Name Attribute" anchor="roster-syntax-items-name">
          <t>The 'name' attribute of the &lt;item/&gt; element specifies the "handle" to be associated with the JID, as determined by the user (not the contact).  Although the value of the 'name' attribute MAY have meaning to a human user, it is opaque to the server.  However, the 'name' attribute MAY be used by the server for matching purposes within the context of various XMPP extensions (one possible comparison method is that described for XMPP resourceparts in <xref target='XMPP-ADDR'/>).</t>
          <t>It is OPTIONAL for a client to include the 'name' attribute when adding or updating a roster item.</t>

          <t>In a <xref target='roster-syntax-actions-set'>roster set</xref>, the 'subscription' attribute MAY be included with a value of "remove", which indicates that the item is to be removed from the roster; in a roster set the server MUST ignore all values of the 'subscription' attribute other than "remove".</t>
          <t>Inclusion of the 'subscription' attribute is OPTIONAL.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Group Element" anchor="roster-syntax-items-group">
          <t>The &lt;group/&gt; child element specifies a category or "bucket" into which the roster item is to be grouped by a client.  An &lt;item/&gt; element MAY contain more than one &lt;group/&gt; element, which means that roster groups are not exclusive.  Although the XML character data of the &lt;group/&gt; element MAY have meaning to a human user, it is opaque to the server.  However, the &lt;group/&gt; element MAY be used by the server for matching purposes within the context of various XMPP extensions (one possible comparison method is that described for XMPP resourceparts in <xref target='XMPP-ADDR'/>).</t>
          <t>It is OPTIONAL for a client to include the &lt;group/&gt; element when adding or updating a roster item.  If a <xref target='roster-syntax-actions-set'>roster set</xref> includes no &lt;group/&gt; element, then the item is to be interpreted as being affiliated with no group.</t>

However, this specification allows entities other than the user's server to maintain roster information, which means that a roster push might include a 'from' address other than the bare JID of the user's account.  Therefore, the client MUST check the 'from' address to verify that the sender of the roster push is authorized to update the roster.  If the client receives a roster push from an unauthorized entity, it MUST NOT process the pushed data; in addition, the client can either return a stanza error of &lt;service-unavailable/&gt; error or refuse to return a stanza error at all (the latter behavior overrides a MUST-level requirement from <xref target='XMPP-CORE'/> for the purpose of preventing a presence leak).</t></list></t>

    <section title="Retrieving the Roster on Login" anchor="roster-login">
      <t>Upon authenticating with a server and binding a resource (thus becoming a connected resource as defined in <xref target='XMPP-CORE'/>), a client SHOULD request the roster before sending initial presence (however, because receiving the roster is not necessarily desirable for all resources, e.g., a connection with limited bandwidth, the client's request for the roster is not mandatory).  After a connected resource sends initial presence (see <xref target='presence-initial'/>), it is referred to as an "available resource".  If a connected resource or available resource requests the roster, it is referred to as an "interested resource".  The server MUST send roster pushes to all interested resources.</t>
      <t><list style='empty'><t>Implementation Note: Presence subscription requests are sent to available resources, whereas the roster pushes associated with subscription state changes are sent to interested resources.

  <section title="Managing Presence Subscriptions" anchor="sub">
    <t>In order to protect the privacy of XMPP users, presence information is disclosed only to other entities that a user has approved.  When a user has agreed that another entity is allowed to view its presence, the entity is said to have a "subscription" to the user's presence.  An entity that has a subscription to a user's presence or to which a user has a presence subscription is called a "contact" (in this document the term "contact" is also used in a less strict sense to refer to a potential contact or any item in a user's roster).</t>
    <t>In XMPP, a subscription lasts across presence sessions; indeed, it lasts until the contact unsubscribes or the user cancels the previously-granted subscription.  (This model is different from that used for presence subscriptions in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), as defined in <xref target='SIP-PRES'/>.)</t>
    <t>Subscriptions are managed within XMPP by sending presence stanzas containing specially-defined attributes ("subscribe", "unsubscribe", "subscribed", and "unsubscribed").</t>
    <t><list style='empty'><t>Implementation Note: When a server processes or generates an outbound presence stanza of type "subscribe", "subscribed", "unsubscribe", or "unsubscribed", the server MUST stamp the outgoing presence stanza with the bare JID &lt;localpart@domainpart&gt; of the sending entity, not the full JID &lt;localpart@domainpart/resourcepart&gt;.  Enforcement of this rule simplifies the presence subscription model and helps to prevent presence leaks; for information about presence leaks, refer to the security considerations of <xref target='XMPP-CORE'/>.</t></list></t>
    <t>Subscription states are reflected in the rosters of both the user and the contact.  This section does not cover every possible case related to presence subscriptions, and mainly narrates the protocol flows for bootstrapping a mutual subscription between a user and a contact.  Complete details regarding subscription states can be found under <xref target='substates'/>.</t>

    <section title="Requesting a Subscription" anchor="sub-request">
      <t>A "subscription request" is a request from a user for authorization to permanently subscribe to a contact's presence information; syntactically it is a presence stanza whose 'type' attribute has a value of "subscribe".  A subscription request is generated by a user's client, processed by the (potential) contact's server, and acted on by the contact via the contact's client.  The workflow is described in the following sections.</t>
      <t><list style='empty'><t>Implementation Note: Presence subscription requests are sent to available resources, whereas the roster pushes associated with subscription state changes are sent to interested resources.  Therefore if a resource wishes to receive both subscription requests and roster pushes, it MUST both send initial presence and request the roster.</t></list></t>
      <section title="Client Generation of Outbound Subscription Request" anchor="sub-request-gen">
        <t>A user's client generates a subscription request by sending a presence stanza of type "subscribe" and specifying a 'to' address of the potential contact's bare JID &lt;contact@domainpart&gt;.</t>

        </figure>
        <t>When a user sends a presence subscription request to a potential instant messaging and presence contact, the value of the 'to' attribute MUST be a bare JID &lt;contact@domainpart&gt; rather than a full JID &lt;contact@domainpart/resourcepart&gt;, since the desired result is for the user to receive presence from all of the contact's resources, not merely the particular resource specified in the 'to' attribute.  Use of bare JIDs also simplifies subscription processing, presence probes, and presence notifications by the user's server and the contact's server.</t>
        <t>For tracking purposes, a client SHOULD include an 'id' attribute in a presence subscription request.</t>
        <t><list style='empty'><t>Implementation Note: Many XMPP clients prompt the user for information about the potential contact (e.g., "handle" and desired roster group) when generating an outbound presence subscription request and therefore send a roster set before sending the outbound presence subscription request.  This behavior is OPTIONAL, because a client MAY instead wait until receiving the initial roster push from the server before uploading user-provided information about the contact.  A server MUST process a roster set and outbound presence subscription request in either order (i.e., in whatever order generated by the client).</t></list></t>

      <section title="Server Processing of Outbound Subscription Request" anchor="sub-request-outbound">

        <t>
          <list style='numbers'>
            <t>Before processing the request, the user's server SHOULD check the syntax of the JID contained in the 'to' attribute.

            <t>If the potential contact is hosted on the same server as the user, then the server MUST adhere to the rules specified in the next section when processing the subscription request and delivering it to the (local) contact.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
            <t>If the potential contact is hosted on a remote server, subject to local service policies the user's server MUST then route the stanza to that remote domain in accordance with core XMPP stanza processing rules.  (This can result in returning an appropriate stanza error to the user, such as &lt;remote-server-timeout/&gt;.)</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>As mentioned, before locally delivering or remotely routing the presence subscription request, the user's server MUST stamp the outbound subscription request with the bare JID &lt;user@domainpart&gt; of the user.</t>

        <t>If a remote contact does not approve or deny the subscription request within some configurable amount of time, the user's server SHOULD resend the subscription request to the contact based on an implementation-specific algorithm (e.g., whenever a new resource becomes available for the user, or after a certain amount of time has elapsed); this helps to recover from transient, silent errors that might have occurred when the original subscription request was routed to the remote domain.  When doing so, it is RECOMMENDED for the server to include an 'id' attribute so that it can track responses to the resent subscription request.</t>

      <section title="Server Processing of Inbound Subscription Request" anchor="sub-request-inbound">
        <t>Before processing the inbound presence subscription request, the contact's server SHOULD check the syntax of the JID contained in the 'to' attribute.

        <t>
          <list style='numbers'>
            <t>Above all, the contact's server MUST NOT automatically approve subscription requests on the contact's behalf -- unless the contact has (a) pre-approved subscription requests from the user as described under <xref target='sub-preapproval'/>, (b) configured its account to automatically approve subscription requests, or (c) accepted an agreement with its service provider that allows automatic approval (for instance via an employment agreement within an enterprise deployment).

            <t>If the contact exists and the user already has a subscription to the contact's presence, then the contact's server MUST auto-reply on behalf of the contact by sending a presence stanza of type "subscribed" from the contact's bare JID to the user's bare JID.  Likewise, if the contact previously sent a presence stanza of type "subscribed" and the contact's server treated that as indicating "pre-approval" for the user's presence subscription (see <xref target='sub-preapproval'/>), then the contact's server SHOULD also auto-reply on behalf of the contact.

            <t>Otherwise, if the contact has no available resources when the subscription request is received by the contact's server, then the contact's server MUST keep a record of the complete presence stanza comprising the subscription request, including any extended content contained therein (see Section 8.4 of <xref target='XMPP-CORE'/>), and then deliver the request when the contact next has an available resource.  The contact's server MUST continue to deliver the subscription request whenever the contact creates an available resource, until the contact either approves or denies the request.  (The contact's server MUST NOT deliver more than one subscription request from any given user when the contact next has an available resource; e.g., if the user sends multiple subscription requests to the contact while the contact is offline, the contact's server SHOULD store only one of those requests, such as the first request or last request, and MUST deliver only one of the requests when the contact next has an available resource; this helps to prevent "subscription request spam".)</t>

  <section title="Exchanging Presence Information" anchor="presence">

    <section title="Presence Fundamentals" anchor="presence-fundamentals">
      <t>The concept of presence refers to an entity's availability for communication over a network.  At the most basic level, presence is a boolean "on/off" variable that signals whether an entity is available or unavailable for communication (the terms "online" and "offline" are also used).  In XMPP, an entity's availability is signalled when its client generates a &lt;presence/&gt; stanza with no 'type' attribute, and an entity's lack of availability is signalled when its client generates a &lt;presence/&gt; stanza whose 'type' attribute has a value of "unavailable".</t>
      <t>XMPP presence typically follows a "publish-subscribe" or "observer" pattern, wherein an entity sends presence to its server, and its server then broadcasts that information to all of the entity's contacts who have a subscription to the entity's presence (in the terminology of <xref target="IMP-MODEL"/>, an entity that generates presence is a "presentity" and the entities that receive presence are "subscribers").  A client generates presence for broadcast to all subscribed entities by sending a presence stanza to its server with no 'to' address, where the presence stanza has either no 'type' attribute or a 'type' attribute whose value is "unavailable".  This kind of presence is called "broadcast presence".  (A client can also send "directed presence", i.e., a presence stanza with a 'to' address; this is less common but is sometimes used to send presence to entities that are not subscribed to the user's presence; see <xref target='presence-directed'/>.)</t>
      <t>After a client completes the preconditions specified in <xref target="XMPP-CORE"/>, it can establish a "presence session" at its server by sending <xref target='presence-initial'>initial presence</xref>, where the presence session is terminated by sending <xref target='presence-unavailable'>unavailable presence</xref>.  For the duration of its presence session, a connected resource (in the terminology of <xref target="XMPP-CORE"/>) is said to be an "available resource".</t>
      <t>In XMPP applications that combine messaging and presence functionality, the default type of communication for which presence signals availability is messaging; however, it is not necessary for XMPP applications to combine messaging and presence functionality, and they can provide standalone presence features without messaging (in addition, XMPP servers do not require information about network availability in order to successfully route message and IQ stanzas).</t>
      <t><list style='empty'><t>Informational Note: In the examples that follow, the user is &lt;juliet@example.com&gt;, she has two available resources ("balcony" and "chamber"), and she has three contacts in her roster with a subscription state of "from" or "both": &lt;romeo@example.net&gt;, &lt;mercutio@example.com&gt;, and &lt;benvolio@example.net&gt;.</t></list></t>

In addition, a server MAY periodically send a presence probe to a contact if it has not received presence information or other traffic from the contact in some configurable amount of time; this can help to prevent "ghost" contacts who appear to be online but in fact are not.</t>

For this reason, if the contact currently has available resources then the contact's server SHOULD preserve the 'id' attribute of the contact's original presence stanza (if any) when sending those presence notifications to the probing entity; by contrast, if the contact currently has no available resources, the probing entity is not authorized (via presence subscription) to see the contact's presence, or an error occurs in relation to the proble, then the contact's server SHOULD mirror the 'id' of the user's presence probe when replying to the probing entity.</t></list></t>

    <section title="Directed Presence" anchor="presence-directed">
      <t>This section supplements the rules for client and server processing of presence notifications and presence probes, but only for the special case of directed presence.</t>
      <section title="General Considerations" anchor="presence-directed-considerations">
        <t>In general, a client sends directed presence when it wishes to share availability information with an entity that is not subscribed to its presence, typically on a temporary basis.  Common uses of directed presence include casual one-to-one chat sessions as described under <xref target='message-chat'/> and multi-user chat rooms as described in <xref target='XEP-0045'/>.</t>
        <t>The temporary relationship established by sharing directed presence with another entity is secondary to the permanent relationship established through a presence subscription.  Therefore, the acts of creating, modifying, or cancelling a presence subscription MUST take precedence over the rules specified in the following subsections.  For example, if a user shares directed presence with a contact but then adds the contact to the user's roster by completing the presence subscription "handshake", the user's server MUST treat the contact just as it would any normal subscriber as described under <xref target='sub'/>, for example by sending subsequent presence broadcasts to the contact.  As another example, if the user then cancels the contact's subscription to the user's presence, the user's server MUST handle the cancellation just as it normally would as described under <xref target='sub-cancel'/>, which includes sending unavailable presence to the contact even if the user has sent directed presence to the contact.</t>
        <t>XMPP servers typically implement directed presence by keeping a list of the entities (bare JIDs or full JIDs) to which a user has sent directed presence during the user's current session for a given resource (full JID), then clearing the list when the user goes offline (e.g., by sending a broadcast presence stanza of type "unavailable").  The server MUST remove from the directed presence list (or its functional equivalent) any entity to which the user sends directed unavailable presence and SHOULD remove any entity that sends unavailable presence to the user.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Client Generation of Directed Presence" anchor="presence-directed-gen">
        <t>As noted, directed presence is a client-generated presence stanza with a 'to' attribute whose value is the bare JID or full JID of the other entity and with either no 'type' attribute (indicating availability) or a 'type' attribute whose value is "unavailable".</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Server Processing of Outbound Directed Presence" anchor="presence-directed-outbound">
        <t>When the user's server receives a directed presence stanza, it SHOULD process it according to the following rules.</t>
        <t>
          <list style='numbers'>
            <t>If the user sends directed available or unavailable presence to a contact that is in the user's roster with a subscription type of "from" or "both" after having sent initial presence and before sending unavailable presence broadcast (i.e., during the user's presence session), the user's server MUST locally deliver or remotely route the full XML of that presence stanza but SHOULD NOT otherwise modify the contact's status regarding presence broadcast (i.e., it SHOULD include the contact's JID in any subsequent presence broadcasts initiated by the user).<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
            <t>If the user sends directed presence to an entity that is not in the user's roster with a subscription type of "from" or "both" after having sent initial presence and before sending unavailable presence broadcast (i.e., during the user's presence session), the user's server MUST locally deliver or remotely route the full XML of that presence stanza to the entity but MUST NOT modify the contact's status regarding available presence broadcast (i.e., it MUST NOT include the entity's JID in any subsequent broadcasts of available presence initiated by the user); however, if the available resource from which the user sent the directed presence becomes unavailable, the user's server MUST route that unavailable presence to the entity (if the user has not yet sent directed unavailable presence to that entity).<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
            <t>If the user sends directed presence without first sending initial presence or after having sent unavailable presence broadcast (i.e., the resource is connected but not available), the user's server MUST treat the entity to which the user sends directed presence as in case #2 above.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          </list>

      <section title="Server Processing of Inbound Directed Presence" anchor="presence-directed-inbound">
        <t>From the perspective of the contact's server, there is no significant difference between presence broadcast and directed presence, so the contact's server follows the rules for processing of inbound presence defined under <xref target='presence-probe-inbound'/>, <xref target='presence-broadcast-inbound'/>, and <xref target='presence-unavailable-inbound'/>.</t>

      </section>
      <section title="Server Processing of Presence Probes" anchor="presence-directed-probe">
        <t>If a user's client has sent directed presence to another entity (e.g., a one-to-one chat partner or a multi-user chat room), after some time the entity or its server might want to know if the client is still online.  This scenario is especially common in the case of multi-user chat rooms, in which the user might be a participant for a long period of time.  If the user's client goes offline without the chat room being informed (either by the client or the client's server), the user's representation in the room might become a "ghost" which appears to be participating but which in fact is no longer present in the room.  To detect such "ghosts", some multi-user chat room implementations send presence probes to users that have joined the room.</t>
        <t>In the case of directed presence, the probing entity SHOULD send the probe from the JID that received directed presence (whether a full JID or a bare JID).  The probe SHOULD be sent to the user's full JID, not the user's bare JID without a resourcepart, because the temporary "authorization" involved with directed presence is based on the full JID from which the user sent directed presence to the probing entity.  When the user's server receives a probe, it MUST first apply any logic associated with presence subscriptions as described under <xref target='presence-probe-inbound'/>.  If the probing entity does not have a subscription to the user's presence, then the server MUST check if the user has sent directed presence to the entity during its current session; if so, the server SHOULD answer the probe with only mere presence of type "available" or "unavailable" (i.e., not including child elements) and only for that full JID (i.e., not for any other resources that might be currently associated with the user's bare JID).</t>

    <section title="Presence Syntax" anchor="presence-syntax">
      <section title="Type Attribute" anchor="presence-syntax-type">
        <t>The absence of a 'type' attribute signals that the relevant entity is available for communication (see <xref target='presence-initial'/> and <xref target='presence-broadcast'/>).</t>
        <t>A 'type' attribute with a value of "unavailable" signals that the relevant entity is not available for communication (see <xref target='presence-unavailable'/>).</t>
        <t>The XMPP presence stanza is also used to negotiate and manage subscriptions to the presence of other entities.  These tasks are completed via presence stanzas of type "subscribe", "unsubscribe", "subscribed", and "unsubscribed" as described under <xref target='sub'/>.</t>
        <t>If a user and contact are associated with different XMPP servers, those servers also use a special presence stanza of type "probe" in order to determine the availability of the entity on the peer server; details are provided under <xref target='presence-probe'/>.  Clients SHOULD NOT send presence stanzas of type "probe".</t>
        <t>The values of the 'type' attribute can be summarized as follows:</t>
        <t>
          <list style='symbols'>
            <t>error -- An error has occurred regarding processing of a previously-sent presence stanza; if the presence stanza is of type "error", it MUST include an &lt;error/&gt; child element (refer to <xref target="XMPP-CORE"/>).<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
            <t>probe -- A request for an entity's current presence; SHOULD be generated only by a server on behalf of a user.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>

            <t>subscribed -- The sender has allowed the recipient to receive their presence.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
            <t>unavailable -- The sender is no longer available for communication.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
            <t>unsubscribe -- The sender is unsubscribing from the receiver's presence.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
            <t>unsubscribed -- The subscription request has been denied or a previously-granted subscription has been cancelled.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>If the value of the 'type' attribute is not one of the foregoing values, the recipient or an intermediate router SHOULD return a stanza error of &lt;bad-request/&gt;.</t>

        <t>In accordance with the default namespace declaration, a presence stanza is qualified by the 'jabber:client' or 'jabber:server' namespace, which defines certain child elements of presence stanzas, in particular the &lt;show/&gt;, &lt;status/&gt;, and &lt;priority/&gt; elements.  These child elements are used to provide more detailed information about an entity's availability.  Typically these child elements are included only if the presence stanza possesses no 'type' attribute, although exceptions are noted in the text that follows.</t>
        <section title="Show Element" anchor="presence-syntax-children-show">
          <t>The OPTIONAL &lt;show/&gt; element specifies the particular availability sub-state of an entity or a specific resource thereof.  A presence stanza MUST NOT contain more than one &lt;show/&gt; element.  There are no attributes defined for the &lt;show/&gt; element.  The &lt;show/&gt; element MUST NOT contain mixed content (as defined in Section 3.2.2 of <xref target="XML"/>).  The XML character data of the &lt;show/&gt; element is not meant for presentation to a human user.  The XML character data MUST be one of the following (additional availability states could be defined through extended content elements):</t>
          <t>
            <list style='symbols'>

        <section title="Status Element" anchor="presence-syntax-children-status">
          <t>The OPTIONAL &lt;status/&gt; element contains human-readable XML character data specifying a natural-language description of an entity's availability.

  <section title="Exchanging Messages" anchor="message">
    <t>Once a client has authenticated with a server and bound a resource to an XML stream as described in <xref target="XMPP-CORE"/>, an XMPP server will route XML stanzas to and from that client.  One kind of stanza that can be exchanged is &lt;message/&gt; (if, that is, messaging functionality is enabled on the server).  Exchanging messages is a basic use of XMPP and occurs when a user generates a message stanza that is addressed to another entity.  As defined under <xref target="rules"/>, the sender's server is responsible for delivering the message to the intended recipient (if the recipient is on the same local server) or for routing the message to the recipient's server (if the recipient is on a remote server).  Thus a message stanza is used to "push" information to another entity.</t>
    <section title="One-to-One Chat Sessions" anchor="message-chat">
      <t>In practice, instant messaging activity between human users tends to occur in the form of a conversational burst that we call a "chat session": the exchange of multiple messages between two parties in relatively rapid succession within a relatively brief period of time.</t>
      <t>When a human user intends to engage in such a chat session with a contact (rather than sending a single message to which no reply is expected), the message type generated by the user's client SHOULD be "chat" and the contact's client SHOULD preserve that message type in subsequent replies.   The user's client also SHOULD include a &lt;thread/&gt; element with its initial message, which the contact's client SHOULD also preserve during the life of the chat session (see <xref target='message-syntax-thread'/>).</t>
      <t>The user's client SHOULD address the initial message in a chat session to the bare JID &lt;contact@domainpart&gt; of the contact (rather than attempting to guess an appropriate full JID &lt;contact@domainpart/resourcepart&gt; based on the &lt;show/&gt;, &lt;status/&gt;, or &lt;priority/&gt; value of any presence notifications it might have received from the contact).  Until and unless the user's client receives a reply from the contact, it SHOULD send any further messages to the contact's bare JID.  The contact's client SHOULD address its replies to the user's full JID &lt;user@domainpart/resourcepart&gt; as provided in the 'from' address of the initial message.  Once the user's client receives a reply from the contact's full JID, it SHOULD address its subsequent messages to the contact's full JID as provided in the 'from' address of the contact's replies, thus "locking in" on that full JID.  A client SHOULD "unlock" after having received a &lt;message/&gt; or &lt;presence/&gt; stanza from any other resource controlled by the peer (or a presence stanza from the locked resource); as a result, it SHOULD address its next message(s) in the chat session to the bare JID of the peer (thus "unlocking" the previous "lock") until it receives a message from one of the peer's full JIDs.</t>
      <t>When two parties engage in a chat session but do not share presence with each other based on a presence subscription, they SHOULD send directed presence to each other so that either party can easily discover if the peer goes offline during the course of the chat session.  However, a client MUST provide a way for a user to disable such presence sharing globally or to enable it only with particular entities.  Furthermore, a party SHOULD send directed unavailable presence to the peer when it has reason to believe that the chat session is over (e.g., if, after some reasonable amount of time, no subsequent messages have been exchanged between the parties).</t>
      <t>An example of a chat session is provided under <xref target='session'/>.</t>

        <t>If the message is being sent outside the context of any existing chat session or received message, the value of the 'to' address SHOULD be of the form &lt;localpart@domainpart&gt; rather than of the form &lt;localpart@domainpart/resourcepart&gt; (see <xref target='message-chat'/>).</t>

      <section title="Type Attribute" anchor="message-syntax-type">
      <t>Common uses of the message stanza in instant messaging applications include: single messages; messages sent in the context of a one-to-one chat session; messages sent in the context of a multi-user chat room; alerts, notifications, or other information to which no reply is expected; and errors.  These uses are differentiated via the 'type' attribute.  Inclusion of the 'type' attribute is RECOMMENDED.  If included, the 'type' attribute MUST have one of the following values:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>chat -- The message is sent in the context of a one-to-one chat session.  Typically an interactive client will present a message of type "chat" in an interface that enables one-to-one chat between the two parties, including an appropriate conversation history.  Detailed recommendations regarding one-to-one chat sessions are provided under <xref target='message-chat'/>.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          <t>error -- The message is generated by an entity that experiences an error when processing a message received from another entity (for details regarding stanza error syntax, refer to <xref target="XMPP-CORE"/>).  A client that receives a message of type "error" SHOULD present an appropriate interface informing the original sender regarding the nature of the error.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          <t>groupchat -- The message is sent in the context of a multi-user chat environment (similar to that of <xref target="IRC"/>).  Typically a receiving client will present a message of type "groupchat" in an interface that enables many-to-many chat between the parties, including a roster of parties in the chatroom and an appropriate conversation history.  For detailed information about XMPP-based groupchat, refer to <xref target="XEP-0045"/>.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          <t>headline -- The message provides an alert, a notification, or other transient information to which no reply is expected (e.g., news headlines, sports updates, near-real-time market data, or syndicated content).  Because no reply to the message is expected, typically a receiving client will present a message of type "headline" in an interface that appropriately differentiates the message from standalone messages, chat messages, and groupchat messages (e.g., by not providing the recipient with the ability to reply).  If the 'to' address is the bare JID, the receiving server SHOULD deliver the message to all of the recipient's available resources with non-negative presence priority and MUST deliver the message to at least one of those resources; if the 'to' address is a full JID and there is a matching resource, the server MUST deliver the message to that resource; otherwise the server MUST either silently ignore the message or return an error (see <xref target='rules'/>).<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          <t>normal -- The message is a standalone message that is sent outside the context of a one-to-one conversation or groupchat, and to which it is expected that the recipient will reply.  Typically a receiving client will present a message of type "normal" in an interface that enables the recipient to reply, but without a conversation history.  The default value of the 'type' attribute is "normal".</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>An IM application SHOULD support all of the foregoing message types.  If an application receives a message with no 'type' attribute or the application does not understand the value of the 'type' attribute provided, it MUST consider the message to be of type "normal" (i.e., "normal" is the default).</t>
      <t>Guidelines for server handling of different message types is provided under <xref target='rules'/>.</t>
      <t>Although the 'type' attribute is OPTIONAL, it is considered polite to mirror the type in any replies to a message; furthermore, some specialized applications (e.g., a multi-user chat service) MAY at their discretion enforce the use of a particular message type (e.g., type='groupchat').</t>

        <t>The primary use of the XMPP &lt;thread/&gt; element is to uniquely identify a conversation thread or "chat session" between two entities instantiated by &lt;message/&gt; stanzas of type 'chat'.

It MAY also be used for &lt;message/&gt; stanzas not related to a human conversation, such as a game session or an interaction between plugins.

        <t>The inclusion of the &lt;thread/&gt; element is OPTIONAL.  Because the &lt;thread/&gt; element identifies the particular conversation thread to which a message belongs, a message stanza MUST NOT contain more than one &lt;thread/&gt; element.</t>

    <t>As described in <xref target="XMPP-CORE"/>, IQ stanzas provide a structured request-response mechanism.  The basic semantics of that mechanism (e.g., that the 'id' attribute is mandatory) are defined in <xref target="XMPP-CORE"/>, whereas the specific semantics needed to complete particular use cases are defined in all instances by the extended namespace that qualifies the direct child element of an IQ stanza of type "get" or "set".  The 'jabber:client' and 'jabber:server' namespaces do not define any children of IQ stanzas other than the &lt;error/&gt; element common to all stanza types.

  <section title="Server Rules for Processing XML Stanzas" anchor="rules">
    <t>Basic server rules for processing XML stanzas are defined in <xref target="XMPP-CORE"/>, and the reader is referred to that specification for underlying rules and security implications.  This section defines supplementary rules for XMPP instant messaging and presence servers.</t>
    <t>Some delivery rules defined in this section specify the use of "offline storage", i.e., the server's act of storing a message stanza on behalf of the user and then delivering it when the user next becomes available.  For recommendations regarding offline message storage, refer to <xref target='XEP-0160'/>.</t>
    <section title="General Considerations" anchor="rules-general">
      <t><xref target="XMPP-CORE"/> discusses general considerations for stanza delivery, in particular the tradeoffs between (i) providing an acceptable level of service regarding stanza delivery and (ii) preventing directory harvesting attacks and presence leaks.  However, the concept of a directory harvesting attack does not apply if a contact is known to and trusted by a user (because the contact is in the user's roster as described under <xref target='roster'/>).  Similarly, the concept of a presence leak does not apply if a contact is authorized to know a user's presence (by means of a presence subscription as described under <xref target='sub'/>) or if the user has voluntarily sent presence to an entity (by means of directed presence as described under <xref target='presence-directed'/>).  Therefore, in cases where the following sections guard against directory harvesting attacks and presence leaks by providing an alternative of (a) silently ignoring a stanza or (b) returning an error, a server SHOULD return an error if the originating entity is in the user's roster (when the error would reveal whether the user's account exists) or is authorized to receive presence from the user or has received directed presence from the user (when the error would reveal the presence of a user's resource).</t>
      <t><list style='empty'><t>Security Warning: All of the stanza processing rules described below are defined with the understanding that they will be applied subject to enforcement of relevant privacy and security policies, such as those deployed by means of <xref target='XEP-0016'/> or <xref target='XEP-0191'/>.  The conformance language (MUST, SHOULD, etc.) in the following sections is not meant to override any such local service policies.</t></list></t>
    </section>
    <section title="No 'to' Address" anchor="rules-noto">
      <t>If the stanza possesses no 'to' attribute, the rules defined in <xref target='XMPP-CORE'/> apply.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Remote Domain" anchor="rules-remote">
      <t>If the domainpart of the address contained in the 'to' attribute of an outbound stanza does not match a configured domain of the server itself, then the server MUST attempt to route the stanza to the remote domain, subject to local security policies.  If there exists an active stream between the two peers, then the server SHOULD route the stanza over that stream for processing by the peer server; if not, then the server SHOULD attempt to resolve the domain name of the remote server in adherence with the rules defined in <xref target="XMPP-CORE"/>, negotiate XML streams with the remote domain, and route the stanza to the remote domain.  However, if the server cannot resolve the remote domain, then it MUST return a &lt;remote-server-not-found/&gt; stanza error to the local sender.</t>
      <t><list style='empty'><t>Implementation Note: RFC 3921 described use of the _im._xmpp and _pres._xmpp SRV records (defined in <xref target='IMP-SRV'/>) to discover the appropriate protocol for communication with remote instant messaging and presence services.  Because those SRV records have not been widely deployed, this specification no longer actively recommends that they be deployed or supported; see RFC 3921 regarding the proper formats and resolution processes.</t></list></t>
    </section>
    <section title="Local Domain" anchor="rules-local">
      <t>If the domainpart of the JID contained in the 'to' attribute matches one of the configured domains of the server, the domain is serviced by the server itself (not by a specialized local service), and the JID is of the form &lt;domainpart&gt; or &lt;domainpart/resourcepart&gt;, the rules defined in <xref target='XMPP-CORE'/> apply.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Local User" anchor="rules-localpart">
      <t>If the 'to' address specifies a bare JID &lt;localpart@domainpart&gt; or full JID &lt;localpart@domainpart/resourcepart&gt; where the domainpart of the JID matches a configured domain that is serviced by the server itself, the server MUST proceed as follows.</t>

The subsequent columns list the four primary message types (normal, chat, groupchat, or headline) along with six possible delivery options: storing the message offline (O), bouncing the message with a stanza error (E), silently ignoring the message (S), delivering the message to the resource specified in the 'to' address (D), delivering the message to the "most available" resource or resources according to the server's implementation-specific algorithm, e.g., treating the resource or resources with the highest presence priority as "most available" (M), or delivering the message to all resources with non-negative presence priority (A -- where for chat messages "all resources" can mean the set of resources that have explicitly opted in to receiving every chat message).  The '/' character stands for "exclusive or".  The server SHOULD observe the rules given in section 8.1 when choosing which action to take for a particular message.</t>

  <section title="Handling of URIs" anchor="uri">
    <t>The addresses of XMPP entities as used in communication over an XMPP network (e.g., in the 'from' and 'to' addresses of an XML stanza) MUST NOT be prepended with a Uniform Resource Identifier <xref target="URI"/> scheme.</t>
    <t>However, an application that is external to XMPP itself (e.g., a page on the World Wide Web) might need to identify an XMPP entity either as a URI or as an Internationalized Resource Identifier <xref target="IRI"/>, and an XMPP client might need to interact with such an external application (for example, an XMPP client might be invoked by clicking a link provided on a web page).  In the context of such interactions, XMPP clients are encouraged to handle addresses that are encoded as "xmpp:" URIs and IRIs as specified in <xref target='XMPP-URI'/> and further described in <xref target='XEP-0147'/>.  Although XMPP clients are also encouraged to handle addresses that are encoded as "im:" URIs as specified in <xref target="CPIM"/> and "pres:" URIs as specified in <xref target='CPP'/>, they can do so by removing the "im:" or "pres:" scheme and entrusting address resolution to the server as specified under <xref target="rules-remote"/>.</t>

    <t>For internationalization considerations, refer to the relevant section of <xref target="XMPP-CORE"/>.</t>
  </section>

  <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">
    <t>Core security considerations for XMPP are provided in Section 13 of <xref target="XMPP-CORE"/>, including discussion of channel encryption, authentication, information leaks, denial of service attacks, and interdomain federation.</t>
    <t>Section 13.1 of <xref target="XMPP-CORE"/> outlines the architectural roles of clients and servers in typical deployments of XMPP, and discusses the security properties associated with those roles.  These roles have an impact on the security of instant messages, presence subscriptions, and presence notifications as described in this document.  In essence, an XMPP user registers (or has provisioned) an account on an XMPP server and therefore places some level of trust in the server to complete various tasks on the user's behalf, enforce security policies, etc.  Thus it is the server's responsibility to:</t>
    <t>
      <list style='numbers'>
        <t>Preferably mandate the use of channel encryption for communication with local clients and remote servers.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
        <t>Authenticate any client that wishes to access the user's account.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
        <t>Process XML stanzas to and from clients that have authenticated as the user (specifically with regard to instant messaging and presence functionality, store the user's roster, process inbound and outbound subscription requests and responses, generate and handle presence probes, broadcast outbound presence notifications, route outbound messages, and deliver inbound messages and presence notifications).</t>
      </list>
    </t>
    <t>As discussed in Sections 13.1 and 13.4 of <xref target="XMPP-CORE"/>, even if the server fulfills the foregoing responsibilities, the client does not have any assurance that stanzas it might exchange with other clients (whether on the same server or a remote server) are protected for all hops along the XMPP communication path, or within the server itself.  It is the responsibility of the client to use an appropriate technology for encryption and signing of XML stanzas if it wishes to ensure end-to-end confidentiality and integrity of its communications.</t>
    <t>Additional considerations that apply only to instant messaging and presence applications of XMPP are defined in several places within this document; specifically:</t>
    <t>
      <list style='symbols'>
        <t>When a server processes an inbound presence stanza of type "probe" whose intended recipient is a user associated with one of the server's configured domains, the server MUST NOT reveal the user's presence if the sender is an entity that is not authorized to receive that information as determined by presence subscriptions (see <xref target="presence"/>).<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
        <t>A user's server MUST NOT leak the user's network availability to entities who are not authorized to know the user's presence.  In XMPP itself, authorization takes the form of an explicit subscription from a contact to the user (as described under <xref target='sub'/>).  However, some XMPP deployments might consider an entity to be authorized if there is an existing trust relationship between the entity and the user who is generating presence information (as an example, a corporate deployment of XMPP might automatically add the user's presence information to a private directory of employees if the organization mandates the sharing of presence information as part of an employment agreement).<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
        <t>When a server processes an outbound presence stanza with no type or of type "unavailable", it MUST follow the rules defined under <xref target="presence"/> in order to ensure that such presence information is not sent to entities that are not authorized to know such information.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
        <t>A client MAY ignore the &lt;status/&gt; element when contained in a presence stanza of type "subscribe", "unsubscribe", "subscribed", or "unsubscribed"; this can help prevent "presence subscription spam".<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>

<date month='December' day='20' year='2010' />
<abstract><t>This document defines the core features of the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), a technology for streaming Extensible Markup Language (XML) elements in order to exchange structured information in close to real time between any two or more network- aware entities. XMPP provides a generalized, extensible framework for incrementally exchanging XML data, upon which a variety of applications can be built. The framework includes methods for stream setup and teardown, channel encryption, authentication of a client to a server and of one server to another server, and primitives for push-style messages, publication of network availability information ("presence"), and request-response interactions between any two XMPP entities. This document obsoletes RFC 3920.</t></abstract>

<abstract>
<t>Presence and Instant Messaging have recently emerged as a new medium of communications over the Internet.  Presence is a means for finding, retrieving, and subscribing to changes in the presence information (e.g.  "online" or "offline") of other users.  Instant messaging is a means for sending small, simple messages that are delivered immediately to online users.</t>
<t>Applications of presence and instant messaging currently use independent, non-standard and non-interoperable protocols developed by various vendors.  The goal of the Instant Messaging and Presence Protocol (IMPP) Working Group is to define a standard protocol so that independently developed applications of instant messaging and/or   presence can interoperate across the Internet.  This document defines a minimal set of requirements that IMPP must meet.</t></abstract></front>

<abstract><t>This document suggests another way of reforming IETF standards process by formalizing the mechanism for interoperability reporting, as a way of facilitating standards development. It establishes two kinds of reports: a 'Protocol Feature Set', which lays out the set of features from IETF specifications that constitute a protocol, and a 'Protocol Implementation Report', which is submitted by an individual or group to report on implementation and interoperability testing.</t></abstract>

<t>&lt;p>This document defines a new protocol element, the Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI), as a complement of the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). An IRI is a sequence of characters from the Universal Character Set (Unicode/ISO 10646). A mapping from IRIs to URIs is defined, which means that IRIs can be used instead of URIs, where appropriate, to identify resources.&lt;/p>&lt;p> The approach of defining a new protocol element was chosen instead of extending or changing the definition of URIs. This was done in order to allow a clear distinction and to avoid incompatibilities with existing software. Guidelines are provided for the use and deployment of IRIs in various protocols, formats, and software components that currently deal with URIs.&lt;/p></t></abstract></front>

   This memo defines the profile of the MIME Content-Type  for
   directory information for a white-pages person object, based on a
   vCard electronic business card.  The profile definition is independent
   of any particular directory service or protocol.  The profile is
   defined for representing and exchanging a variety of information
   about an individual (e.g., formatted and structured name and delivery
   addresses, email address, multiple telephone numbers, photograph,
   logo, audio clips, etc.).  The directory information used by this
   profile is based on the attributes for the person object defined in
   the X.520 and X.521 directory services recommendations.  The profile
   also provides the method for including a  representation of a
   white-pages directory entry within the MIME Content-Type defined by
   the  document.

  <section title="Subscription States" anchor="substates">
    <t>This section provides detailed information about subscription states and server processing of subscription-related presence stanzas (i.e., presence stanzas of type "subscribe", "subscribed", "unsubscribe", and "unsubscribed").</t>
    <section title="Defined States" anchor="substates-defined">
      <t>There are four primary subscription states (these states are described from the perspective of the user, not the contact):</t>
      <t>
        <list style='hanging'>
          <t hangText="None:">The user does not have a subscription to the contact's presence, and the contact does not have a subscription to the user's presence.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          <t hangText="To:">The user has a subscription to the contact's presence, but the contact does not have a subscription to the user's presence.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          <t hangText="From:">The contact has a subscription to the user's presence, but the user does not have a subscription to the contact's presence.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          <t hangText="Both:">Both the user and the contact have subscriptions to each other's presence (i.e., the union of 'from' and 'to').<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t><list style='empty'><t>Implementation Note: For the purpose of processing subscription-related presence stanzas as described in the following sections, a subscription state of "None" includes the case of the contact not being in the user's roster at all, i.e., an unknown entity from the perspective of the user's roster.</t></list></t>
      <t>The foregoing states are supplemented by various sub-states related to pending inbound and outbound subscriptions, thus yielding nine possible subscription states:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>"None" = Contact and user are not subscribed to each other, and neither has requested a subscription from the other; this is reflected in the user's roster by subscription='none'.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          <t>"None + Pending Out" = Contact and user are not subscribed to each other, and user has sent contact a subscription request but contact has not replied yet; this is reflected in the user's roster by subscription='none' and ask='subscribe'.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          <t>"None + Pending In" = Contact and user are not subscribed to each other, and contact has sent user a subscription request but user has not replied yet; this state might or might not be reflected in the user's roster, as follows: if the user has created a roster item for the contact then the server MUST maintain that roster item and also note the existence of the inbound presence subscription request, whereas if the user has not created a roster item for the contact then the user's server MUST note the existence of the inbound presence subscription request but MUST NOT create a roster item for the contact (instead, the server MUST wait until the user has approved the subscription request before adding the contact to the user's roster).<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          <t>"None + Pending Out+In" = Contact and user are not subscribed to each other, contact has sent user a subscription request but user has not replied yet, and user has sent contact a subscription request but contact has not replied yet; this is reflected in the user's roster by subscription='none' and ask='subscribe'.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          <t>"To" = User is subscribed to contact (one-way); this is reflected in the user's roster by subscription='to'.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          <t>"To + Pending In" = User is subscribed to contact, and contact has sent user a subscription request but user has not replied yet; this is reflected in the user's roster by subscription='to'.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          <t>"From" = Contact is subscribed to user (one-way); this is reflected in the user's roster by subscription='from'.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          <t>"From + Pending Out" = Contact is subscribed to user, and user has sent contact a subscription request but contact has not replied yet; this is reflected in the user's roster by subscription='from' and ask='subscribe'.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          <t>"Both" = User and contact are subscribed to each other (two-way); this is reflected in the user's roster by subscription='both'.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>

        <t>When the user's server receives a presence stanza of type "subscribed" for the user from the contact, if there is no pending outbound request for access to the contact's presence information, then it MUST NOT change the subscription state and (because there is no state change) SHOULD NOT deliver the stanza to the user.  If there is a pending outbound request for access to the contact's presence information and the inbound presence stanza of type "subscribed" results in a subscription state change, then the user's server MUST change the subscription state and MUST deliver the stanza to the user.  If the user already is subscribed to the contact's presence information, the inbound presence stanza of type "subscribed" does not result in a subscription state change; therefore the user's server MUST NOT change the subscription state and (because there is no state change) SHOULD NOT deliver the stanza to the user.  These rules are summarized in the following table.</t>

    <t>Sections 2.3.5 and 5.4.10 of <xref target='IMP-REQS'/> require that a compliant instant messaging and presence technology needs to enable a user to block communications from selected users.  Protocols for doing so are specified in <xref target='XEP-0016'/> and <xref target='XEP-0191'/>.</t>

      <t>Sections 3.1.3 and 4.1.4 of <xref target="IMP-REQS"/> require that it be possible to retrieve out-of-band contact information for other users (e.g., telephone number or email address).  An XML representation of the vCard specification defined in <xref target="VCARD">RFC 2426</xref> is in common use within the XMPP community to provide such information but is out of scope for this specification (documentation of this protocol is contained in <xref target="XEP-0054"/>).</t>

    <section title="Differences From RFC 3921" anchor="diffs">
      <t>Based on consensus derived from implementation and deployment experience as well as formal interoperability testing, the following substantive modifications were made from <xref target='RFC3921'/> (in addition to numerous changes of an editorial nature).</t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>The protocol for session establishment was determined to be unnecessary and therefore the content previously defined in Section 3 of RFC 3921 was removed.  However, for the sake of backward-compatibility server implementations are encouraged to advertise support for the feature, even though session establishment is a "no-op".</t>
          <t>In order to more seamlessly repair lack of synchronization in subscription states between rosters located at different servers, clarified and modified error handling related to presence subscription requests, presence probes and presence notifications.</t>
          <t>Changed the 'from' address for presence probes so that it is the bare JID, not the full JID.</t>
          <t>Adjusted and clarified stanza delivery rules based on implementation and deployment experience.</t>
          <t>Explicitly specified that a server is allowed to deliver a message stanza of type "normal" or "chat" to all resources if it has a method for allowing resources to opt in to such behavior.</t>
          <t>Allowed a server to use its own algorithm for determining the "most available" resource for the purpose of message delivery, but mentioned the recommended algorithm from RFC 3921 (based on presence priority) as one possible algorithm.</t>
          <t>Added optional versioning of roster information to save bandwidth in cases where the roster has not changed (or has changed very little) between sessions; the relevant protocol interactions were originally described in <xref target='XEP-0237'/>.</t>
          <t>Added optional server support for pre-approved presence subscriptions via presence stanzas of type "subscribed", including a new 'approved' attribute that can be set to "true" (for a pre-approved subscription) or false (the default).</t>
          <t>Added optional 'parent' attribute to &lt;thread/&gt; element</t>
          <t>Moved the protocol for communications blocking (specified in Section 10 of RFC 3921) back to <xref target='XEP-0016'/>, from which it was originally taken.</t>
          <t>Recommended returning presence unavailable in response to probes.</t>
          <t>Clarified handling of presence probes sent to full JIDs.</t>
          <t>Explicitly specified that the default value for the presence &lt;priority/&gt; element is zero.</t>
          <t>Removed recommendation to support the "_im" and "_pres" SRV records.</t>
