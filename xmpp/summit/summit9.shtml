<p>Thanks once again to gracious assistance from <a href='http://www.oreilly.com/'>O'Reilly Conferences</a>, the XMPP Summit will be held at the <a href='http://www.oregoncc.org/'>Oregon Convention Center</a> on Monday July 19 and Tuesday July 20, 2008.</p>

<p>Exact room number to follow.</p>

<p>You <em>do not</em> need to register for OSCON in order to participate in the XMPP Summit. OSCON is a great conference and we encourage you to attend! However, if you want to participate only in the XMPP Summit, you MUST sign in for a free "floor pass" with O'Reilly when you arrive at the convention center.</p>

<t>For transportation, use Portland's <a href='http://trimet.org/max/'>MAX</a> (light rail) service. The Convention Center stop is your friend. :)</p>

<p>During the summit itself, we will use the <a href='xmpp:summit@conference.jabber.org?join'>summit@conference.jabber.org</a> chatroom as a backchannel for discussion, information sharing, complaints, questions, etc.</p>

<a name='events'></a><h3>Events</h3>

<p>The XSF will attempt to host one social event (dinner or somesuch) and we will also have many opportunities to meet in the evenings for some good Portland beer. :)</p>

<p>Details to follow.</p>
