<title>XMPP Summit 1</title>
<!--#include virtual="/includes/head.txt" -->
<h2>XMPP Summit 1</h2>

<p>The first developer conference held by the <a href='/xsf/'>XMPP Standards Foundation</a> occurred on July 24 and 25, 2006, in Portland, Oregon, USA (the same week as <a href='http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2006/'>OSCON 2006</a>).</p>

<p>Note: The following information is archived here for historical purposes (last updated 2006-07-25).</p>

<h3> Purpose </h3>
<p>The purpose of this event was to test interoperability between multiple
implementations of the XMPP RFCs (3920 and 3921). All participants were
be expected to file implementation reports (in accordance with a format
and template yet to be developed), which will form one input to the
process of advancing the XMPP specifications from Proposed Standard to
Draft Standard within the Internet Standards Process at the IETF (see
<a href='http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2026.html'>RFC 2026</a>). 
The other expected outcome will be a consensus set of
proposed modifications and clarifications to the XMPP RFCs for
discussion on the mailing list of the XMPP WG after the event concludes.  
</p>

<h3> Focus </h3>
<p>The main focus of this event will be server testing. Testing of clients
that are in or near full compliance with the XMPP RFCs will also occur
(XMPP is a client-server technology, so we need both), but given the
large number of Jabber/XMPP clients it will not be feasible to test very
many clients. A set of test cases will be published several months in
advance for use by the participants. The test cases will focus only on
protocol compliance, not scalability, reliability, ease of use, or other
such factors.
</p>
<p>This will be a small, developer-only event. No customers, no marketing
people, no guano. All bugs will stay in the room.
</p>
<p>This is not a more general developer conference. While the JSF may hold
such conferences in the future, this is a small, focused, interop
testing event. However, participants are encouraged to attend OSCON
(same week, same city) and to get involved in Jabber-related activities
there.
</p>

<h3> Logistics </h3>
<p>The JSF will charge $200 per person in order to cover costs associated with hosting of the event. This fee will be waived for open-source developers. Please make payment via PayPal to the address "paypal@jabber.org" or by check to JSF P.O. Box 1641 Denver CO 80201 USA. You may also pay in person at the event.
</p>
<p>Although originally we thought space might be limited because of the venue, that is no longer the case. Multiple participants from participating companies are welcome.
</p>

The list is <a href="http://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/interop/" class='external' title="http://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/interop/" >publicly archived</a>.</p>

<h3> Interop Activities </h3>
<p>All work and no play makes XMPP a sad protocol. On Monday at 6:30 we'll gather for dinner at <a href="http://portland.citysearch.com/profile/40854242" class='external' title="http://portland.citysearch.com/profile/40854242" >Henry's</a>, which is a short walk from the interop venue.
The cost of dinner is included with the interop event fees. On Tuesday at 5:00 (or when the interop event
wraps up), all are invited to the Jive Software office (also a short walk) for an Oregon beer and wine tasting.
