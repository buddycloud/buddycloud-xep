    <ul>
      <li>Founded in 2001 to ensure open protocol documentation and development</li>

      <li>Standards work is inexpensive (email lists, website, etc.)</li>
      <li>No major effort yet to recruit sponsors</li>
      <li>Current bank account balance: $7627.53 (note: $5500 forthcoming from Google Summer of Code involvement)</li>
      <li>There has been discussion in the past about other efforts (compliance testing, official software projects, conferences, interop events, etc.) but no consensus / decision</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Board needs to select Chair for 2005-2006</p>

  <li>
    <p>Setting priorities for 2005-2006; some possibilities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Interop event in first half of 2006 (resulting in interop reports that will smoothe the way to Draft status for XMPP RFCs)</li>
      <li>Clarification of Jabber vs. XMPP "branding" (greater separation of functions by domain?)</li>
      <li>Compliance testing software or services</li>
