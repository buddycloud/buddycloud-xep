    <p>Trademark Transfer Status</p>
    <p>Discussed status of transferring the JABBER trademark from Jabber, Inc. to the Jabber Software Foundation. The agreement was signed on May 5 and will run for at least 12 months; some flexibility required given the fact that the JSF's program is not up and running yet. Sticking point is website content, which was substantially borrowed from that of the Linux Mark Institute. Tony to follow up with legal counsel regarding website content. Peter to inform the Board of the URL for the prototype website.</p>

    <p>Clarification of XMPP.ORG Work Team Charter</p>
    <p>Much discussion regarding the scope of work to be pursued by the XMPP.ORG Work Team.

    <p>The new Council is working swiftly to clear out old JEPs and move forward with a number of high-priority protocols (file transfer, pubsub, etc.).</p>
    <p>Discussion of the need to make compliance a priority and move forward with a testing program, especially given the seemingly imminent approval of the XMPP Internet-Drafts; Peter to follow up with Compliance Team chair regarding next steps.</p>
