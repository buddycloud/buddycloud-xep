    <p>Brief report by Peter on JSF history, status, and financials</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Founded in 2001 to ensure open protocol documentation and development</li>
      <li>Focus so far on standards development (<a href="http://www.jabber.org/jeps/">JEP series</a>)</li>
      <li>JSF provides only a legal structure for standards work</li>
      <li>Standards work is inexpensive (email lists, website, etc.)</li>
      <li>No major effort yet to recruit sponsors</li>
      <li>Current bank account balance: $7627.53 (note: $5500 forthcoming from Google Summer of Code involvement)</li>
      <li>There has been discussion in the past about other efforts (compliance testing, official software projects, conferences, interop events, etc.) but no consensus / decision</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ensuing discussion resulted in the following action item:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Peter to present financial statement for 2004 to the Board (after review, the Board may determine that an audit, required by the Bylaws, is not justified at this time).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Board needs to select Chair for 2005-2006</p>
    <p>Outcome: Carl Malamud selected as Chair.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Board needs to name <a href="http://www.jabber.org/jsf/execdir.shtml">Executive Director</a>, <a href="http://www.jabber.org/jsf/secretary.shtml">Secretary</a>, and <a href="http://www.jabber.org/jsf/treasurer.shtml">Treasurer</a></p>
    <p>Outcome: Peter Saint-Andre selected as Executive Director, Ulrich Staudinger selected as Secretary, Peter to recruit a new Treasurer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Setting priorities for 2005-2006; some possibilities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Interop event in first half of 2006 (resulting in interop reports that will smoothe the way to Draft status for XMPP RFCs)</li>
      <li>Clarification of Jabber vs. XMPP "branding" (greater separation of functions by domain?)</li>
      <li>Compliance testing software or services</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Outcome: Further Board discussion to occur on the board@jabber.org list. Peter to provide an initial proposal for an interop event.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Schedule next meeting.</p>
    <p>Outcome: The next meeting is tentatively scheduled for the first week of November.</p>
  </li>
