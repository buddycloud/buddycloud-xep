<h3>Preamble</h3>
<p>Since Jeremie Miller invented the Jabber technologies in 1998, the term "Jabber" has been used to describe a number of different things, including a server, a protocol, a communications network, a developer community, a set of technologies, even a company. Over time, we have worked to disambiguate the term "Jabber". For example, Jeremie renamed the original Jabber server "jabberd". Another example is that when we submitted our core XML streaming protocols to the IETF, we did so under the name Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP). But we still use the term "Jabber" with regard to the protocols published through the Jabber Software Foundation's JEP series (where JEP stands for "Jabber Enhancement Proposal"). Unfortunately, this usage causes confusion -- is "XMPP" only what is defined in RFCs 3920 and 3921, whereas all the various extensions to XMPP are to be called "Jabber"? In the opinion of the author of this proposal, it is time to reduce the confusion by calling the protocols published by the JSF what in fact they are: XMPP extensions. Therefore, in accordance with Section 3.12 of the <a href='http://www.jabber.org/jsf/bylaws.shtml'>JSF Bylaws</a>, the author formally makes the following proposal for consideration at the 2006 Annual Meeting of the JSF.</p>

<h3>Proposal</h3>
<p>The Jabber Software Foundation shall:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Rename "Jabber Enhancement Proposal" to "XMPP Extension Protocol" (and JEP to XEP).</li>
  <li>Rename "Jabber Council" to "XMPP Council" (including appropriate modifications to Section 8.1 of the JSF Bylaws).</li>
  <li>Rename "Jabber Registrar" to "XMPP Registrar".</li>
  <li>Move the JEP, Council, and Registrar web pages from www.jabber.org to www.xmpp.org.</li>
</ol>

<p>END</p>
