<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>
<h3>Open Source Community Recognizes XMPP as Instant Messaging Standard</h3>
<h4>Beyond IM, XMPP Increasingly Used as Basic Transport for XML Data</h4>
<p>PORTLAND, ORE. - O'Reilly Open Source Convention - July 9, 2003 - The Jabber Software Foundation (JSF), a non-profit organization that manages open application protocols built on top of the IETF's Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), today announced that more than 400 open source projects have embraced XMPP as their IM, messaging, and XML-transport protocol of choice.  </p>
<p>In addition to the open source projects behind XMPP, the JSF also announced that open source libraries for XMPP and Jabber exist in C, C++, C#, Delphi, Flash, Java, Objective-C, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, and Tcl. The JSF also confirms that Jabber clients have been written for Linux, MacOS, and Windows, as well as less common platforms such as Amiga, BeOS, emacs, J2ME, Newton, and PalmOS. This means that users of Jabber can easily communicate with other users on almost any platform and that developers have a rich resource library with which they can choose almost any development platform.</p>
<p>The JSF went on to confirm that the open source Jabberd server has been downloaded more than 175,000 times, that there are well in excess of 10,000 active servers on the Jabber network, and that there are approximately 7-10 million worldwide users of commercial and open source implementations of Jabber and XMPP. Adoption by prominent companies and open-source projects such as HP, Hitachi, IBM Global Services, Ximian, and DotGNU provides further confirmation that Jabber and XMPP are here to stay.</p>
<p>"Since its formation in 1998, the Jabber movement has attracted a dedicated, passionate, and talented army of volunteers and commercial developers," said Peter Saint-Andre, executive director of the JSF.  "The fruits of this labor are a stable development environment that is rapidly reaching a point of critical mass whereby Jabber/XMPP is now a ubiquitous protocol for messaging, presence, and real-time XML."</p>
