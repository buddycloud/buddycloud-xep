<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>
<h3>Jabber Software Foundation to Hold XMPP Interop Test Event July 24-25, 2006</h3>
<h4>Meeting in Portland, Ore. to Coincide with O'Reilly Open Source Convention (OSCON)</h4>

<p>DENVER, CO, USA, JULY 11, 2006 -- The Jabber Software Foundation (<a href='http://www.jabber.org/'>JSF</a>) will soon hold an interoperability testing event related to the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (<a href='/'>XMPP</a>), a standard for presence and near-real-time messaging approved by the Internet Engineering Task Force (<a href='http://www.ietf.org/'>IETF</a>) in 2004.</p>
<p>The JSF reports that the main focus of the event is server testing, though testing of clients that are in or near full compliance with the XMPP specifications will also occur. Completion of interoperability testing will help to improve the robustness of various open-source and commercial XMPP implementations. In addition, the resulting interoperability reports will be one input to advancement of the XMPP specifications (Request for Comments (RFC) 3920 and 3921) from Proposed Standard to Draft Standard within the IETF's Internet Standard Process.</p>
<p>According to Peter Saint-Andre, executive director of the JSF, "this will be a small, developer-only event and the JSF will charge a nominal fee for commercial participants to cover costs associated with the Open Source Developer Labs' hosting of this event."  The fee will be waived for open-source developers.</p>
<p>The test event will coincide with the O'Reilly Open Source Convention (<a href='http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2006/'>OSCON</a>) in Portland, Oregon the week of July 24.
