<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>
<h3>XMPP Proven as a Standard for Instant Messaging Interoperability</h3>
<h4>Jabber Community Continues To Play Leadership Role in Push towards IM and Presence Interoperability</h4>

<p>DENVER, COLO., OCTOBER 15, 2003 -- The Jabber Software Foundation (JSF), the non-profit organization that builds open application protocols on top of the IETF's Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), today announced the public availability of gateways to two of the leading protocols for instant messaging, SIMPLE and Wireless Village (OMA - Open Mobile Alliance IMPS).</p>

<p>XMPP is an open protocol widely used as the common connection between open source and proprietary IM systems.  The protocol is expected to be ratified soon by the IETF as an Internet standard for instant messaging.  XMPP grew out of the Jabber open-source project, and continues to be developed and extended within both the IETF and the broader Jabber community, including the JSF.  The JSF reports that more than 215,000 open source XMPP servers have been deployed with a total worldwide user base of approximately 7-10 million people.</p>

<p>Responding to customer-driven demands for seamless communication between disparate IM systems, two JSF sponsors have used the open XMPP protocol as the basis for their work. The XMPP-to-SIMPLE gateway was built by Antepo, Inc. and the XMPP-to-IMPS gateway was built by Jabber, Inc.  The XMPP-to-SIMPLE gateway is available for public evaluation at sametime.xmpp.org.</p>

<p>"The Jabber community has always deeply valued interoperability, and it is fantastic to see commercial companies such as Antepo and Jabber, Inc.  continue the strong tradition begun by open-source developers," said Peter Saint Andre, the JSF's executive director.  "The fact that Jabber/XMPP is both extensible and modular makes it the natural platform on which to build interoperable systems."</p>

<p>"The XMPP-to-SIMPLE gateway extends XMPP networks to other relevant and leading players in the marketplace.  For example, it interoperates with IBM's Lotus SameTime, the largest enterprise IM installed base," said Don Bergal, VP of Business Development for Antepo.  "This initiative highlights XMPP's central role in deploying open, cohesive and global presence architectures."</p>

<p>"The XMPP-to-IMPS, also known as Wireless Village, gateway is a great example of XMPP's native ability to act as a neutral internetworking technology for multi-protocol interoperability," said Tony Bamonti, Jabber, Inc.'s VP of Open Alliances and Standards.  "XMPP/Jabber has historically been used as a protocol bridge to connect proprietary messaging systems, such as AIM, ICQ, MSN, and others, and is now demonstrating a similar ability to interconnect systems based on different emerging IM protocol standards."</p>
