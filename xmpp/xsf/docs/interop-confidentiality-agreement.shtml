<p>"Service" shall mean any Application that is or can be connected to other Services in the Network.</p>

<p>"Network" shall mean the Services that are interconnected under the auspices of the Provider for the purpose of interoperability testing over the Internet; the sum total of such Services and the communications between them comprise the "XMPP Interoperability Testing Network".</p>

<p>"Producer" shall mean any Individual, Project, or Legal Entity that has created an Application and that has been approved by the Provider for participation in the Network.</p>

<p>"Individual" shall mean a natural person who is an independent Producer.</p>

<h2><a name='participation'></a>2.0 Participation at Will</h2>

<p>Participation in the Network is subject to acceptance and approval by the Provider, which shall include but not necessarily be limited to Your agreement to the terms and conditions specified herein. Violation of the terms and conditions specified herein shall subject You to suspension or termination of Your participation in the Network. Decisions regarding suspension or termination of participation may be appealed to the Board of Directors of the XMPP Standards Foundation.</p>

<h2><a name='confidentiality'></a>3.0 Confidentiality</h2>

<p>By participating in the Network, You agree to forever keep private and confidential any and all knowledge gained about any and all other Services, Applications, and Producers that participate in the Network.</p>

<h2><a name='copyrights'></a>4.0 Retention of Copyrights and Patents</h2>

<p>Participation in the Network MUST NOT be construed as awarding any rights or licenses from a Producer to the Provider or to other Producers over any copyrights and patents held by the Producer.

<h2><a name='liability'></a>6.0 Limitation of Liability</h2>

<p>In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall Provider or any Producer be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of Your participation in the Network (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if Provider or Producer has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
