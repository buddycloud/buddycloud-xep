Attachment: Part X, Line 3

The XMPP Standards Foundation (XSF) effectively has had no adjusted net
income throughout its history, since it has subsisted on contributions
received from sponsoring organizations. Therefore the XSF appears to 
meet the income test required by the definition of a private operating
foundation.

All of the assets of the XSF are devoted directly to the conduct of its
scientific, technical, and educational activities, and the XSF does not
hold any assets for the purposes of income production or investment, or
for any similar purpose. Therefore the XSF appears to meet the assets 
test required by the definition of a private operating foundation.
