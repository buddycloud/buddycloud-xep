The primary activity of the XMPP Standards Foundation (XSF) is publication of a
document series entitled XMPP Extension Protocols (XEPs). Each XEP specifies a
protocol extension to, or technical best practice related to, the Extensible 
Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) for real-time communication over the
Internet. Copyright in all such documents is held by the XSF. All protocols 
developed by the XSF are provided free of charge with no restrictions on
implementation thereof, in accordance with the XSF's Intellectual Property 
Rights policy:

The XSF defines protocols and publishes relevant documentation, but does not
implement the protocols in software or hardware or deploy such software or
hardware. However, such implementation and deployment can be completed by any 
individual or organization, and the XSF does not assert any intellectual property 
rights over such implementations and deployments.
