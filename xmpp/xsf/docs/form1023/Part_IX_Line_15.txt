In 2005, the XMPP Standards Foundation (XSF) participated in the "Google 
Summer of Code" program, through which experienced individuals from the 
XMPP technical community mentored students from universities in the USA 
and other countries who worked on software projects selected by the XSF
and approved by Google. Each mentor who worked on such a project was 
provided with a grant of $500 for their participation, resulting in 
total grants of $1,000 for 2005.
