    <p>The JSF has 96 <a href="/members/memberlist.shtml">members</a> as of this date. Therefore quorum is achieved.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Items Subject to a Vote</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>RESOLVED that the following Section 2.9 be added to the JSF Bylaws:</p>
        <p><B>Section 2.9  <U>Terms of Membership</U>.</B> Membership in the Corporation shall be valid for a period of one (1) year, measured from the date of the Members' meeting at which the member was admitted or last re-admitted. In order for an individual's membership not to lapse after 12 months, the member must (i) re-apply during the membership application period that begins 12 months after the application period during which the member last applied and (ii) be re-admitted in accordance with the procedures defined in Section 2.1. For the purposes of instituting this policy, members accepted in 2001 shall re-apply in July 2003 and members accepted in 2002 shall re-apply in October 2003; thereafter, members shall re-apply according to the 12-month rule (e.g., members accepted in January 2003 shall re-apply in January 2004).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>RESOLVED that the following Section 8.3 be added to the JSF Bylaws:</p>
        <p><B>Section 8.3  <U>JSF Work Teams</U>.</B> The Board of Directors or the Members of the Corporation may, by resolution, establish one or more JSF Work Teams ("Teams"). Participation in Teams shall be limited to elected Members of the Corporation. The Board shall approve, or the Members shall elect, the chair of each such Team. Unless elected or appointed as an officer in accordance with Article 6 of these Bylaws, a member of a Team shall not be deemed an officer of the Corporation.</p>
        <p>Each Team shall be responsible for the active management of one or more projects identified by resolution of the Board or of the Members of the Corporation as of importance to the affairs of the Corporation, or shall act in an advisory capacity to the Board or a Committee of the Board. The specific nature of the Team's responsibilities shall be defined by a Team Charter, which must be approved by the Board. The Charter shall also define the process by which Team members shall be chosen or approved. The chair of each Team shall be primarily responsible for the advisory functions and work items of the Team, and the chair shall establish rules and procedures for the day-to-day management of the Team's activities, consistent with the Team Charter. All Teams shall report to and be supervised by the Board of Directors, and Team budgets must be approved by the Board.</p>
        <p>The Board of Directors or the Members of the Corporation may, by resolution, remove a Team chair or terminate a Team at any time for any reason. A Team shall not be considered a committee of the Board of Directors. A Team may not have and may not exercise any of the power and authority of the Board of Directors.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>RESOLVED that Section 8.2 of the JSF Bylaws be amended to read as follows:</p>
        <p><B>Section 8.2  <U>Jabber Interest Groups</U>.</B> The Board of Directors, the Jabber Council, or the Members of the Corporation may, by resolution, establish one or more Jabber Interest Groups ("JIGs"). A JIG is an open forum in which the Jabber community may discuss topics that are addressed officially by a JSF Work Team or the Jabber Council. While a Work Team or the Jabber Council may take account of JIG discussions when making decisions related to its responsibilities, it is under no obligation to do so, and a JIG does not act in an official advisory capacity to a Work Team or the Council. Because a JIG is an open forum, participation in a JIG shall not be limited to elected Members of the Corporation, and shall be open to any interested individual. Leadership and direction for a JIG shall be provided by the members (and in particular by the Chair) of the relevant JSF Work Team or the Jabber Council.</p>
        <p>Unless elected or appointed as an officer in accordance with Article 6 of these Bylaws, a member of a JIG shall not be deemed an officer of the Corporation. Unless elected as a Member of the Corporation in accordance with Article 2 of these Bylaws, a member of a JIG shall not be deemed a Member of the Corporation.</p>
        <p>The Board of Directors, the Jabber Council, or the Members of the Corporation may, by resolution, terminate a JIG at any time for any reason. A JIG shall not be considered a committee of the Board of Directors, of the Jabber Council, or of the Members of the Corporation. A JIG may not have and may not exercise any of the power and authority of the Board of Directors, the Jabber Council, an approved JSF Work Team, or the Members of the Corporation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>RESOLVED that Section 8.1 of the JSF Bylaws be amended to read as follows:</p>
        <p><B>Section 8.1 <U>Jabber Council</U>.</B> The Corporation shall have an advisory council ("Jabber Council") to provide technical advice to the Corporation, to approve changes to the Jabber protocol, and to oversee and direct the activities of certain Jabber Interest Groups. In discharging its responsibilities, the Jabber Council shall adhere to the policies, procedures and standards approved by the Board of Directors.</p>
        <p>The individuals on the Jabber Council shall be elected by an affirmative vote of a majority of the Members of the Corporation voting, at each annual meeting of the Members. The individuals elected to the Jabber Council shall, by an affirmative majority vote of those present and voting, appoint the chair of such Council. All the individuals elected to participate on the Jabber Council must be Members of the Corporation.</p>
        <p>If a Council member resigns his or her membership in the Corporation, is removed from membership in the Corporation, or is terminated from membership in the Corporation, he or she shall thereby relinquish all rights and responsibilities as a member of the Council. In addition, a Council member may be involuntarily removed from the Council by an affirmative vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the members of the Council. The Council shall at its discretion determine whether to fill any vacancies on the Council caused by resignation or removal of an existing Council member.</p>
        <p>The Jabber Council shall not be considered a committee of the Board of Directors. The Jabber Council may not have and may not exercise any of the power and authority of the Board of Directors. The Jabber Council shall act upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the Council voting, although the negative vote of any one member of the Council shall function as a veto. A quorum of the Jabber Council shall be a majority of the members of the Council. The provisions of these Bylaws with regard to meetings, notice, etc. that apply to Membership meetings shall apply to the Jabber Council and members thereof unless such provisions are inconsistent with this Article VIII. The Jabber Council shall keep regular minutes of its proceedings and report the same to the Board.</p>
