Jive Software is the developer of the Openfire server, Spark client, and Smack Java library, three leading professional Open Source projects for EIM, presence, and XMPP-based communications. Built using pure Java, Openfire is a scalable, secure, cross-platform XMPP server that can be easily and quickly customized using simple plugins. It installs in a matter of minutes and provides enterprise-class features such as message auditing, archiving and LDAP integration. An enterprise edition of Openfire is also available under a commercial license.
