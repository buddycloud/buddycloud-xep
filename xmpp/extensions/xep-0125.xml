<section1 topic='Introduction'>
  <p>&xep0120; defines a protocol for capturing granular information (or "infobits") about users, servers, services, rooms, nodes, commands, files, and other phenomena on the Jabber/XMPP network; however, that document defines the protocol only, not the infobits themselves. This document specifies how to encapsulate one sort of metadata in infobits: the metadata elements about entities defined by &rfc2426; (supplemented by vCard-like metadata that is not defined in RFC 2426), thus enabling the Jabber community to supersede &xep0054;. Note well that this document is decidedly <em>not</em> meant to provide an exhaustive catalog of possible infobits. Future registrations, whether in XMPP Extension Protocol specifications or direct submissions to the &REGISTRAR;, will specify additional infobits.</p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='vCard Mapping'>
  <p>In order to supersede the vCard-XML protocol currently in use within the Jabber community, it is necessary to define infobits that correspond to the data elements defined by the vCard-XML DTD (more precisely, the vCard Profile Features specified in section 3 of RFC 2426). These are shown in the following table. (Note: this mapping uses the vCard entity names specified in &dawson3;, not those specified in XEP-0054.)</p>
