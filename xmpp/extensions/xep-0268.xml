<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <p>As XMPP technologies have been deployed more widely, the open XMPP network has become a more significant target for attacks. This specification defines ways for XMPP server deployments to share information with each other and therefore to handle such attacks in a more real-time fashion. In particular, it defines a format for sharing incident reports among XMPP server deployments. (For some related considerations, see &rfc2350;, &rfc3067;, and &rfc5070;.)</p>
</section1>

<section1 topic='Incident Reports' anchor='reports'>
  <p>An incident report consists of an XMPP &MESSAGE; stanza containing an &lt;incident/&gt; child element that includes an 'id' attribute whose value is a UUID as described in &rfc4122;. An example is shown below. A server deployment SHOULD send incident reports only to peer servers that it trusts, for example peers that are in its "server roster" as described in &xep0267;.</p>

<section1 topic='Incident Solutions' anchor='solutions'>
  <p>If the reporting entity determines a solution to the problem or a receiving entity has a suggested solution to the problem, it SHOULD send out a revised incident report containing a &lt;solution/&gt; element (alternatively, the reporting entity can include a solution in its initial report). The solution element can include any of the elements defined for the &lt;description/&gt; element, such as the &lt;ip/&gt; element (since the XMPP server of a source JID might know the IP address and port of the connected entity).</p>

<section1 topic='Processing of Incident Reports' anchor='processing'>
  <p>Unless explicitly configured to do so, a receiving server SHOULD NOT automatically modify its configuration based on receipt of an incident report, even from a trusted server, but instead SHOULD prompt the human administrators so that they can take appropriate action.</p>
  <p>A receiving server MAY accept incident reports from peers that are not on its "trust list", but SHOULD treat such reports with caution and provide them to the human administrator(s) of the server.</p>
  <p>A receiving server MAY forward reports that it receives to other servers it trusts.</p>
</section1>

<section1 topic='Security Considerations' anchor='security'>
  <p>This technology is designed to help mitigate attacks on the XMPP network. However, incident reporting is itself vulnerable to the following attacks:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>False reports could lead a server to deny service to legitimate users or peer servers (see also &xep0205;). To help mitigate such attacks, a server SHOULD treat with caution any incident reports that it might receive from untrusted entities.</li>
    <li>If traffic between two servers is not protected using Transport Layer Security (TLS), a passive eavesdropper could gain access to incident reports and therefore adjust its behavior in response. To prevent such attacks, servers SHOULD use TLS.</li>
  </ul>

    </ul>
    <p>Upon advancement of this specification from a status of Experimental to a status of Draft, the &REGISTRAR; shall add the foregoing namespace to the registry located at &NAMESPACES;, as described in Section 4 of &xep0053;.</p>
