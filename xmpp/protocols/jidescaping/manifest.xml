  <title>JID Escaping</title>
  <abstract>This specification defines a mechanism that enables the display in Jabber Identifiers (JIDs) of characters disallowed by the Nodeprep profile of stringprep. Although these characters -- space, double quote, ampersand, single quote, forward slash, colon, less than, greater than, and at-sign -- cannot be included in XMPP node identifiers, JID Escaping provides a native XMPP escaping mechanism for these characters so that the displayed version of a Jabber Identifier can appear to include these characters. This mechanism can also be used to translate non-XMPP addreses into XMPP syntax, for example when gatewaying between XMPP and a non-XMPP communications technology such as email.</abstract>
