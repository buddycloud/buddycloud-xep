  <title>Personal Eventing via Pubsub</title>
  <abstract>This specification defines semantics for using the XMPP publish-subscribe protocol to broadcast state change events associated with an instant messaging and presence account. This profile of pubsub therefore enables a standard XMPP user account to function as a virtual pubsub service, easing the discovery of syndicated data and event notifications associated with such an account.</abstract>
