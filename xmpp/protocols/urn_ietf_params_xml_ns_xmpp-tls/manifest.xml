  <title>Transport Layer Security</title>
  <abstract>This specification defines the core channel encryption method for XMPP: an application profile of Transport Layer Security (TLS) that enables a client to encrypt its XML streams with a server or for one server to encrypt its XML streams with a peer server. By its nature as a TLS profile, XMPP channel encryption also includes the ability to compress XML streams.</abstract>
