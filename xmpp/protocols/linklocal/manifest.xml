  <title>Link-Local Messaging</title>
  <abstract>This specification defines how to establish XMPP-like communications over local networks based on zero-configuration networking. This method uses DNS-based Service Discovery and Multicast DNS to discover entities that support the protocol, including their IP addresses and preferred ports. Any two entities can then negotiate a serverless connection using standard XML streams in order to exchange XMPP message and IQ stanzas.</abstract>
