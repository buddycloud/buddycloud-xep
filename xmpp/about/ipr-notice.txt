In accordance with Section 10 of RFC 2026, Jabber, Inc. and the
Jabber Software Foundation (JSF) wish to make the following joint
statement regarding the JABBER trademark.

Parts of the specifications produced by the Extensible Messaging and 
Presence Protocol (XMPP) Working Group use the term "jabber" for the
purpose of identifying namespaces and other protocol syntax in XMPP.  
These documents currently consist of the following:

- draft-ietf-xmpp-core
- draft-ietf-xmpp-cpim
- draft-ietf-xmpp-e2e
- draft-ietf-xmpp-im

Future IETF specifications, not limited to those produced by the XMPP
Working Group, may use the term "jabber" in a similar fashion, and 
this statement is not restricted to the documents cited above.

JABBER(R) is a registered trademark of Jabber, Inc., and was acquired
from the previous trademark holder in order to safeguard use of the 
term in reference to XML streaming technologies, especially as applied 
to instant messaging and presence.  

Licensing of the JABBER trademark is administered by the JSF, to which
Jabber, Inc. has granted a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license 
for sub-licensing of the trademark. The JSF recognizes a number of 
uses of the term "jabber" that fall under descriptive use or fair use,
including protocol names, general technology references, and domain 
names; such usage does not require a license. However, use of the term 
"jabber" in software titles and company or organization names does 
require licensing of that use by the JSF. Detailed information 
regarding licensing of the JABBER trademark may be found here:
